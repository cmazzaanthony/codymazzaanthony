I'm Cody Mazza-Anthony, a data scientist. I am currently a Senior Data Scientist at Shopify where I build
analytics and ML tools for merchants. Previously, I worked as a quant at Squarepoint Capital and an engineer at
Morgan Stanley.

On the side, I love helping start-ups with all things data.

I graduated with a double major in Computer Science and Biology and a masters
in Machine Learning from McGill University.

In my free time, I like woodworking and writing. 

I'm best reached via email.
