I'm Cody Mazza-Anthony, a machine learning engineer. I am currently a Staff Machine Learning Engineer at Shopify where I work on Shopify's AI assistant, [Sidekick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVvbY7A7lIQ). Previously, I worked as a quant at Squarepoint Capital and an engineer at
Morgan Stanley.

On the side, I love helping start-ups with all things data.

I graduated with a double major in Computer Science and Biology and a masters
in Machine Learning from [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en) and McGill University under the supervision of [Mark Coates](https://mila.quebec/en/directory/mark-coates).

In my free time, I like woodworking and writing. 

I'm best reached via email.
